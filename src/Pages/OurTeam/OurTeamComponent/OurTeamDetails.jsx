                                On one hand, Shri Karan Singh Uchiyarda is a respected name in the Jodhpur's business circle, on the other, he is known for giving back to society through his trust Shree Mag Mohan Charitable Trust. His social welfare work includes medical camps, large-scale marriage functions, housing, and other donation for the poor and needy. What's more, in a very unique and commendable CSR initiative, Ashapurna Buildcon provides a free home to a widow in every project which in itself is living proof of Shri Karan Singh Uchiyardas concern towards the less privileged section of society.
