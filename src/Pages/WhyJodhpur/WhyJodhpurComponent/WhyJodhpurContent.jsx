                                Jodhpur, famously known as the Blue City of India, is the second-largest city in Rajasthan. Established in 1459 by Rao Jodha, a chief of the Rathore clan, the city was originally called Marwar. It was renamed Jodhpur in honor of its founder. The city is divided into two distinct areas: the old city and the new city. The old city, surrounded by a 10-km-long wall with eight gates, is a major tourist attraction, housing iconic landmarks. In contrast, the new city is a modern hub that accommodates Jodhpur's major developments.
